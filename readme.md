This application is intended to help Marta users be able to find restaurants as they are planning their travel. The page also helps travellers to get an idea about the Marta schedule for their chosen station by showing them the next train arrival, which is pulled from the Marta Rest API. Additionally, because many Marta travellers are headed to events that will see them spending time outdoors the app also includes a current weather information box.

The APIs that are called for this project are

1. The Marta API - for train information and current schedule
2. Zomato - for all restaurant information including location, costs, and speciality dishes
3. Open Wather - for current weather information for the city of Atlanta
